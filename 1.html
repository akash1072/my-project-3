                <h3>Online Grocery </h3>
                   <p>An Online Grocery is either a brick-and-mortar supermarket or grocery store that allows online ordering, or a standalone e-commerce service that includes grocery items.<br> There is usually a delivery charge for this service. <br>Brick-and-mortar supermarkets that have built internet channels to better service their clients are known as online grocers.<br> Online grocery delivery services are available throughout Europe, Asia and North America, mostly in urban centers. <br>The online ordering is done through e-commerce websites or mobile apps.    /p>
                       
                <h3>Data and Online Grocery</h3>
            <p> The biggest advantage that online grocers have vis-a-vis brick-and-mortar store is more accurate data.<br> Online grocers can use AI and machine-learning models to provide a more personalized experience for their customers. <br>There are four main ways to utilize data for online grocers: creating smart shopping lists, personalizing discounts, personalizing the way items are shown to users, and providing contextualized recommendations.<br> All these are intended to increase up-selling and cross-selling options as well as increase the customer's lifetime value.
